# BACKUPS
## nc-backup-auto
Perform automatic backups.

### How to enable
1. Navigate to `nc-backup-auto` in the TUI or the WebUI.
2. Change `ACTIVE` to `yes`.
3. Change `DESTDIR` to a desired location for the backups.
4. Change `INCLUDEDATA` to `yes` (optional), to backup your data as well.
5. Change `BACKUPDAYS` to the number of days to perform the backup.
6. Change `BACKUPLIMIT` to the number of backups to be kept. If limit is reached, then the new backup will replace the older one.
7. Click Run or Start.

## nc-backup
Perform a manual backup.

### How to configure
1. Navigate to `nc-backup` in the TUI or the WebUI.
2. Change `DESTDIR` to the desired location you want your backup to be.
3. Change `INCLUDEDATA` to `yes` if you want to include the Nextcloud data to the backup as well.
4. Change `BACKUPLIMIT` to the number of backups to be kept. If limit is reached, then the new backup will replace the older one.
5. Click Run or Start.

## nc-restore
Restore a previously backuped Nextcloud instance.<br>
If the `data` folder of Nextcloud was not included in the backup: After restoring, edit /var/www/nextcloud/config/config.php and point your Nextcloud instance to the path where the data is. After that run nc-scan to make Nextcloud aware of the new files.

```
file: config.php
...
'datadirectory' => '/<your-path>/ncdata',
...
'logfile' => '/<your-path>/ncdata/nextcloud.log',
...
```

## nc-rsync
To get the rsync connection between the ncp and a backup-server working you need to establish two main steps:
1. The backup-server needs to have a user. This user needs diskspace, the permission for ssh-autologin and the right to use rsync.
2. On your ncp, root needs to be allowed to ssh-autologin to the user of the backup-server.

Step 1: 
Please check what you need to do on your server side. In case you use a Synology NAS (DiskStation, RackStation), you need to enable ssh ("Control Panel", "Terminal & SNMP"), give the user - which you use to backup the data - administration access ("Control Panel", "User"), and enable Rsync ("Control Panel", "File Sharing", "File Services").

Step 2: 
* Login to your ncp on the terminal
* change to the root account (sudo -s)
* go to the home directory of the root (cd ~)
* follow these steps to create the auto-login for the root user: [http://linuxproblem.org/art_9.html](http://linuxproblem.org/art_9.html) (a: root user, A: the IP of the ncp, b: user at the backup-server, B: IP of the backup server)
* make sure that ssh-access works for the root user to the backup-server

After these steps you should be able to backup your data with rsync between the ncp and the backup-server. Test this with the following command:

`rsync -e 'ssh -p 22' -av /home/pi/ b@B:/path/to/your/backup/`

If this works check the following next command:

`rsync -e 'ssh -p 22' -aAv /home/pi/ b@B:/path/to/your/backup/`

If this also works ("A" means ACL-support) then you are fine. If this gives and error message ("ACL not supported on server") then you need to either enable ACL-support on the backup-server-side or you need to tweak the ncp-script in: "/usr/local/etc/ncp-config.d/nc-rsync.sh" and "/usr/local/etc/ncp-config.d/nc-rsync-auto.sh" and remove the "A"-option in the rsync-command of the script (this counts for ncp version 0.64.2, the ACL option might be dropped in later versions, please check).

## nc-rsync-auto
See comments on nc-rsync. This lets you automatically schedule the rsync process every SYNCDAY.


## NFS
Configure a NFS network file system server. This is a lightweight way to mount your cloud files through LAN in a Linux computer.

## dnsmasq
This is a DNS server that you might need in case you cannot access you cloud from inside your house by the external URL, such as _mycloud.freeDNS.org_. This depends on wether your router supports _NAT loopback_. 

See [this post](https://ownyourbits.com/2017/03/09/dnsmasq-as-dns-cache-server-for-nextcloudpi-and-raspbian/) for details.
## fail2ban
As soon as your NextClouPi is connected to the internet it might get attacked. Most attacks are probably automated attacks by botnets or scripts trying to break into your System by simply using standard username/password combinations like admin/admin. [fail2ban](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban/wiki/How-fail2ban-works2) scans your webserver logs (which can be found under /var/log/apache2/error.log) for failed login attempts. If there are to many failed attempts (default is 6 failed attempts within 10 minutes) fail2ban will ban the attacker's IP address for a certain amount of time (default is 10 minutes). If you activate mail alerts you will receive emails when fail2ban locks out certain IP addresses. 
NextCloudPi uses fail2ban to secure Nextcloud logins as well as SSH logins.


### How to activate
Run the TUI (`ncp-config`) or use the WebUI.
1. Change `ACTIVE` to `yes`
2. Change (optional) `BANTIME` (in seconds, default: 600 = 10 minutes) to change the duration of a ban for a certain IP address after too many failed login attempts.
3. Change (optional) `FINDTIME` (in seconds, default: 600 = 10 minutes) to change the time slot in which  failed login attempts are counted and the IP address gets banned.
4. Change (optional) `MAXRETRY` (default: 6 attempts) to change the number of failed login attempts that trigger an IP address ban.
5. Change (optional) `EMAIL` with your personal email to receive ban notifications.
6. Change (optional) `MAILALERTS` to activate/deactivate email notifications.
7. Click Run (WebUI) or Start (TUI)

## DDNS_freeDNS
[FreeDNS](https://freedns.afraid.org/) client.

Most home users do not have a static IP but rather a dynamic IP that changes from time to time. in order for you to be able to access your Nextcloud instance, from outside of your house, without typing an IP address you need a DDNS service which tracks IP changes and updates the DNS records. 

You need to register an account on [FreeDNS](https://freedns.afraid.org/) and setup a (sub)Domain Name.

### How to activate
Run the TUI (`ncp-config`) or use the WebUI.
Log in to freedns.afraid.com and click "Dynamic DNS". Right click on "Direct URL" next to your record. Paste it in a text editor and select only the hash (the letters after the "?").
1. Navigate to `DDNS_freeDNS` in the TUI or the WebUI.
2. Change `ACTIVE` to `yes`
3. Change the `UPDATEHASH` with yours (delete the example and paste with ctrl+shift+V)
4. Change `DOMAIN` with your Domain Name you have registered.
5. (Optional) Change the `UPDATEINTERVAL` to the interval time you want the client to update your IP (Dynamic IPs do not change that often so you can leave the default (5mins)).
6. Click Run or Start.

## letsencrypt

In order to trust a connection to a website and send your user name and password, you need a SSL certificate. The SSL certificate ensures that the communication is encrypted, so everything you send can only be viewed by the server and not someone who impersonates him. By default NextCloudPi provides a self signed SSL certificate in order to encrypt your communication but it is strongly recomended that you use a certificate from a certificate authority. The NextCloudPi can run the Let's Encrypt client which gets a certificate from https://letsencrypt.org for your (sub)Domain Name. NextCloudPi also configures the web server to use it and renews the certificate once a month.

### Configure
1. Navigate to `letsencrypt` in the TUI or the WebUI.
2. Change the `DOMAIN` with your (sub)Domain Name.
3. Change the `EMAIL` with your Email address. (It is recomended to use a valid Email address)
4. Click Run or Start.


## modsecurity
Web Application Firewall for extra security (experimental)

This is a really strong layer of security that makes sure that even if there is a vulnerability in Nextcloud code, it will be blocked by modsecurity in most cases.

The downside is that it can break some Apps, so disable it if something doesn't work for you. Tested with the most common Apps.
