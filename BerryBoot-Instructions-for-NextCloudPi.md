# BerryBoot Instructions for NextCloudPi

### Items Required:

- Linux Computer with USB Ports (optional SD Card Slot)
- micro SD Card with SD Adapter (with USB adapter if system doesn’t have SD Slot)
- USB Flash Drive
- Raspberry Pi connected to a video screen (usually HDMI)


### Notes:

- The Flash Drive and the SD card must be 32GB or less
- FAT32 file system is limited to 32GB
- The Berryboot application is a GUI. So, it must be used with an HDMI TV/Monitor
- Do NOT untar the berryboot files from berryterminal until they are on the SD Card
- The 'Install BerryBoot on micro SD Card' procedure only needs to be performed once. It is performed to place the BerryBoot on a NEW SD Card that has a FAT32 file system. When the NEW SD Card with BerryBoot Application is booted on the Raspberry Pi for the first time, it will partition the SD Card into two partitions: FAT32 for the required BerryBoot application and a Linux Ext4 partition that holds the various Bootable images. After the first boot of the BerryBoot SD Card in the Raspberry Pi, the various Linux bootable images are either downloaded thru the Network or imported from a USB Stick. The USB Stick method is used to import the NextCloudPi Linux image. Once it is imported from the USB Stick, it is stored in the Linux ext4 Partition on the SD Card and the BerryBoot Menu is updated.

### Creating and copying NextCloudPi image to the USB Flash Drive:

1. On a Linux System copy the following files (latest):
    - ‘build-SD-berryboot.sh’ script
    - ‘buildlib.sh’ script
    - ‘NextCloudPi_Rpi_xx-xx-xx.tar.bz2’ (xx-xx-xx = mm-dd-yy)
1. Install squashfs-tools if it is not installed
1. Unzip, then Untar the ‘NextCloudPi_Rpi_xx-xx-xx.tar.bz2’ file
1. Run ‘build-SD-berryboot.sh NextCloudPi_Rpi_xx-xx-xx.tar.bz2’
1. Copy ‘NextCloudPi_Rpi_Berryboot_xx-xx-xx.img’ to the USB Flash Drive
1. Eject the USB Flash Drive
