### What is NextCloudPi?

NextCloudPi is a ready to use image for Raspberry Pi that runs NextCloud software to enable your Pi to be a home cloud server.
This code also generates the [NextCloudPi ARM docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ownyourbits/nextcloudpi/).

### How do I install NextCloudPi on a Raspberry Pi?

Follow the guide [How to install NextCloudPi on a Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloudpi/wiki/How-to-install-NextCloudPi-on-a-Raspberry-Pi).

### How can I access from outside my home network?

See [this guide](https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloudpi/wiki/How-to-access-from-outside)

### I have been updating through `nc-update` but why isn't Nextcloud on the latest version?

`nc-update` only updates NextCloudPi related stuff. In order to upgrade the Nextcloud instance itself you should do it through the internal updater (in admin section of Nextcloud)

### Do I have to configure every entry in the WebUI and the TUI?

No. You only need to run the Wizard to have a working Nextcloud instance. Everything else is optional.

### Can I use an external USB drive with NTFS/FAT filesystem?

No. These do not support the linux user/permission system.

You can read/write to NTFS/FAT filesystems, but the permissions need to be set for the whole drive, which leads to many problems.

Secondly, the performance can be really bad in linux, and this is very noticeable on the pi.

For this reasons, this is not supported. Do it at your own risk.

### How do I connect with SSH to the Raspberry Pi?

There are two ways.

1. You can place an empty file named `ssh` in the boot partition of the sd card (so `/boot/ssh`)
2. You can connect a keyboard and screen to the Raspberry Pi, log in and activate it typing `sudo raspi-config`, then go to the option 'Interfacing Options' > 'SSH'

### What are pre-set users/passwords on NextCloudPi?

* For ssh or terminal pi/raspberry (root/1234 on armbian)
* For https://nextcloudpi.local:4443/ ncp/ownyourbits,  
* For https://nextcloudpi.local ncp/ownyourbits
* For Database user is ncadmin/password is generated dynamically and stored in /root/.my.cnf

### What user/permissions should I have to the external USB drive mount point, the ncdata and ncdatabase directory?

| Directory | User | Group | Permissions | Permission mask |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mount Point | root | root | drwxr-x--x | 751 |
| ncdata | www-data | www-data | drwxr-x--- | 750 |
| ncdatabase | mysql | mysql | drwxr-xr-x | 755 |

### Why does NextCloudPi uses Apache and not Nginx?

Read the blog [post](https://ownyourbits.com/2017/06/12/why-nextcloudpi-uses-apache-and-not-nginx/).

### Why is my md5sum of the image file different than the md5sum on the site?

The md5sum on the site is the md5sum of the `tar.bz2` file that you get after you download, not the image's one.

### Why `dd` command doesn't burn the sd card correctly?

In `dd` command you need to specify the block device, not the partition. E.x.:

```
sudo dd bs=4M if=NextCloudPi_xx-yy-zz.img of=/dev/sda status=progress && sync
```
### Can I boot NextCloudPi from a USB drive instead of the SD card?

Yes, it can be done following [this guide](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/msd.md)

### What if my ISP doesn't allow me to open ports 80 and/or 443?

You can change the port in the apache virtual host files ( in `/etc/apache2/sites-available` ), but the Let's Encrypt authentication process won't work for you.

### How do I set up Let's Encrypt with blocked ports?

 - If you only have port 443 available, you can use the following workaround: copy that code and after that try again from the web interface or `nextcloudpi-config`

```
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/nextcloudpi/beb9bc1ee2909a1ab6bfde7398ddf19a50d02478/etc/nextcloudpi-config.d/letsencrypt.sh -O /usr/local/etc/nextcloudpi-config.d/letsencrypt.sh
```

- If you don't have port 443 available, you will have to do it manually. You can use the Let's Encrypt DNS challenge authentication for this ( [wiki entry](https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloudpi/wiki/How-to-configure-Let's-Encrypt-with-closed-ports-80-and-443) ).

### Why is Nextcloud so slow / failing randomly / getting server errors even with a fresh image?

Most commonly these things are caused by hardware problems.

 - Check your SD card: take it out, copy the whole image to your computer and then copy it back to the SD. Assert that there are no read/write errors. You can also check the md5sum after reading it again and assert that it matches the md5sum of the image that you just copied.
 - Check your power supply. Many cheap power supplies are not stable enough for reliable functioning. Also try to have external supplies for your external HDDs.

### How can I install Plex with NextCloudPi?

First install plex, after configure NextCloudPi, upgrades, etc.
