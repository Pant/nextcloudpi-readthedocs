This guide will help you set up automatic backup to a second USB drive.

_Important: make sure you use the drive label in nc-datadir and other configuration options. Use names such as `/media/myCloudDrive`, instead of `/media/USBdrive`, or otherwise the system will not be able to guess which drive holds the data and which one holds the backups._

## Procedure
1. Complete at least steps 2 and 3 of the [[Guide to configure an external USB drive with NextCloudPi|How-to-configure-an-external-USB-drive-with-NextCloudPi]].
2. Format second USB drive with [`nc-format-USB`][nc-format-USB] (optional but see Note).
3. Configure and activate [`nc-backup-auto`][nc-backup-auto] to the second USB drive".

## Complete required steps from the [[Guide to configure an external USB drive with NextCloudPi|How-to-configure-an-external-USB-drive-with-NextCloudPi]]

You first need to configure this guide. [`nc-backup-auto`][nc-backup-auto] is going to retrieve Nextcloud directory and database and backup them.

## Format second USB drive with [`nc-format-USB`][nc-format-USB] (optional but see Note)

**IMPORTANT:** To format the second USB drive with [`nc-format-USB`][nc-format-USB] you first need to remove the first USB drive!

> **Note: _The disk must not be formated as NTFS/FAT as these do not support the user/permission system.

1. Remove the first USB drive.
2. Navigate to [`nc-format-USB`][nc-format-USB] in the TUI or the WebUI.
3. Change the `LABEL` to a label you like. This is also the name of the directory that the USB drive will mount to (e.x. /media/"myLabel"). **Do not use the same Label to both USB drives!**
4. Click Run or Start.

## Configure and activate [`nc-backup-auto`][nc-backup-auto] to the second USB drive

1. Navigate to [`nc-backup-auto`][nc-backup-auto] in the TUI or the WebUI.
2. Change `ACTIVE` to `yes`.
3. Change `DESTDIR` to the mount point of the second USB drive.
4. Change `INCLUDEDATA` to `yes` if you want to backup Nextcloud data as well (optional).
5. Change `BACKUPDAYS` to a desired number of days to take each backup.
6. Change `BACKUPLIMIT` to a desired amount of backup limit. This means that for example if you set to 3 and time comes to take an other backup, the first back up will be removed and replaced with the new one.

## Final words

This is what you have to do to enable Auto Backups.
