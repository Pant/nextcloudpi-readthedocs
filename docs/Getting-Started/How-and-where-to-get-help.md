## Where

* Your best chance at getting help and getting answers is asking questions on the [forum](https://help.nextcloud.com/c/support/appliances-docker-snappy-vm). **Please do** take the time to investigate (search), maybe your question as already been answered. Thank you!

* For general discussion you can join us at [Telegram chat group](https://t.me/NextCloudPi)

* Only bugs, issues and feature requests concerning NCP code and Wiki should be reported here on [Github](https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloudpi/issues)

## How

* Please be patient, nobody "works" here or has any obligation to help, we do so because we like to do it.

* Try to be precise in describing the problems you are facing, what you are trying to achieve, steps you took, be as informative as you can. A question containing extended information, where you clearly went thru extra trouble to try gather information to make helping you easier, is likely to get a lot more response.

* Make sure you give your question a **meaningful title!** "Help me I'm a Noob or I'm stuck" is not going to raise much interest. 

#### By asking questions and reporting issues, we can all contribute to improving the software we are using. Thank you for contributing!

## Please Don’t

Call yourself a noob in the subject or in text of your question, here or on the forum . Rather use “I am new to” or newb because…….

* Variations (quoted from knowyourmeme. com)

    Although “noob” is still the most popular abbreviation, other variants have emerged since, with each carrying a slightly different meaning or connotation. Some of the most prominent ones include:

    Noob is the standard and most widespread variation. It is most commonly used to new and inexperienced people. They are **commonly seen as annoying and disrespectful**, not willing to learn anything about the subject they are “noob” in. A popular derivative of this is “n00b”[8]. These share the same meaning, but n00b is more commonly used in places where 1337-speak is present.

    Newb is also used towards new and inexperienced players. The common difference with noob is that these people are aware of their inexperience and are willing to learn more about it in order to get better.
